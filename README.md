# python-web-app
Step by step walk through to building a Python web app!

- FastAPI will be the framework driving the architecture
- We also utilise the PyDantic validation methods to assist users with API messages
- Introduce linting, testing and cide coverage reports before any serious development effort
- "Containerise" the app like the testing before any major develoment, this can help testing


My steps:
1 Create a repository
2 Python requirements
3 Testing (PyTest)
4 Creating a FastAPI application
5 Super simple GET request
6 Containerise
7 GitHub Actions - Linting (PyLint)
8 GitHub Actions - Testing (PyTest)
9 Creating routes/blueprinting
